I'm sorry, but errors were detected in your script. Please correct the
errors listed below, and try again.


File "game/script.rpy", line 307: is not terminated with a newline. (Check strings and parenthesis.)
(Perhaps you left out a ' at the end of the first line.)
        (I mutter to myself, trying to convince myself that everything will be fine if I simply pretend they're not there.)"""
